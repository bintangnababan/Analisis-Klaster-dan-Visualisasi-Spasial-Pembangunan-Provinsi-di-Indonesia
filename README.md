# 📊 Multivariate Analysis of Indonesian Provinces

This project analyzes socio-economic indicators across Indonesian provinces using multivariate statistical methods. The analysis includes multiple linear regression, correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and K-Means clustering.

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze relationships between population, population density, HDI, GRDP, and poverty line.
- Identify significant predictors of HDI using multiple regression.
- Reduce data dimensionality using PCA for better visualization.
- Group provinces based on socio-economic similarities using clustering.
